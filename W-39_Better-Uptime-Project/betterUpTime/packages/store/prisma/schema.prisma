// This schema represents a system that keeps track of the health or performance of different websites over time, across different regions. It includes three main data structures: Website, Region, and WebsiteTick.

// A Website is something you want to monitor — like google.com or myshop.com. Each website has a unique ID, its URL, a timestamp of when it was added, and a list of performance records (called ticks).

// A Region is a physical or logical location (like "Asia", "Europe", or "US-East"). Each region also has a unique ID and a name. The system checks the websites from different regions to see how they're performing from those locations.

// The WebsiteTick is like a snapshot or log entry that records how a website performed at a certain moment. Each tick includes:

// A unique ID,

// The response time (how many milliseconds it took the website to respond),

// The status of the website (whether it was "Up", "Down", or "Unknown"),

// And it connects to both a specific website and a specific region — showing where the check was done and which website was being checked.

// The schema also defines an enum called WebsiteStatus, which simply sets fixed possible values for the status of a website — either it's working (Up), not working (Down), or its status is unclear (Unknown).

// Overall, this schema helps build a system where you can monitor websites from different regions, record their response times, and know whether they were accessible or not — all organized in a structured and trackable way.
