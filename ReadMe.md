## SSH keys

SSH keys work using a cryptographic system called public-key authentication, which allows secure access to remote servers without using passwords. When you generate an SSH key pair, you get a private key (which stays on your computer) and a public key (which you place on the server). When you try to connect to the server, your computer uses the private key to prove its identity. The server checks this against the public key you added earlier. If they match, access is granted â€” no password needed. This method is safer and more convenient than using passwords, especially for automated or repeated logins.
